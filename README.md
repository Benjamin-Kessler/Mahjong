# Mahjong

WIP: [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong) game implemented in C++. Currently supports single player mode against three AI opponents using the terminal.

## Relevant files

* [main.cpp](main.cpp): Main script to build
* [Various header files](include/): Various support classes, implemented using header files

## Local execution

Build the [main.cpp](main.cpp) file and run the created executable file. To start a game, type `game` into the terminal. Choices are made by entering the corresponding integer, while `-1` denotes choosing none of the available options.

## Next steps

* Create more policies for AI opponents (using Reinforcement Learning)
* Create a GUI
